## Installation
- This section details the basic views of how to install the different parts of the application such as django, gunicorn and the PostgresSQL database.
### Install Django
### Install PostgresSQL Database
**This is for current Code institute Students only!**
- The Postgres database can be installed for Code Institute Students only by heading to this [link](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/)
- Then inputting the email you use to sign into the LMS (Dashboard) on Code Institute (CI)
- Then you should recieve an email saying the database is created as well as the details for it
- Finally you can add it to your project the same way as when ElephantSQL was working
### Install packages

 - Then you type pip3 install <Name> (<name> is name of package)
 - If you need a required version you can type in the version after the name of the package (Like 20.1.0 for gunicorn)
