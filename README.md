## Design
## Features
## Installation
- This section details the basic views of how to install the different parts of the application such as django, gunicorn and the PostgresSQL database.
### Install Django
### Install PostgresSQL Database
**This is for current Code institute Students only!**
- The Postgres database can be installed for Code Institute Students only by heading to this [link](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/)
- Then inputting the email you use to sign into the LMS (Dashboard) on Code Institute (CI)
- Then you should recieve an email saying the database is created as well as the details for it
- Finally you can add it to your project the same way as when ElephantSQL was working
### Install packages
 - To install the required packages you open the terminal
 - Then you type pip3 install <Name> (<name> is name of package)
 - If you need a required version you can type in the version after the name of the package (Like 20.1.0 for gunicorn)

### Sources
- The fonts were generated by google [fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- The main structure of the code was followed from Code Institutes I think therefore i blog module on their 5 project course.
- Code institutes github account who i checked my code with when i thought i missed a [step.](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/blog)
- Youtube for when i had an error 500 and a heroku h10 error.

### Credits
 - My mentor Spencer Barribal for always providing advice and improvements that i can add to Bite bait
 - One of my old college projects for being a reliable source of information and reminding me on how to do certain parts of the design (like the entity relationship diagrams) aswell as part of the development in python.
 - My fellow peers and friends for giving me the motivation to finish this project when i have suffered with imposter syndrome
 - The code institute Tutor team for helping me solve an issue with error 500.
